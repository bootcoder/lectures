I love how Aaron starts his article by reminding us that, yes, he too is human and usually forgets how to use a more sophisticated debugger simply because, yes, he too is human and forgets :)

I wish programmers in movies forgot how to do stuff, like, just went blank, you know? and then, in the final seconds before the alarms ring out, steel gates come crashing down and helicopters thunder onto nearby ground and burst into a swarm of SWAT that the programmer had to kind of stop, take a breath, and google around for a bit.

and then, and then, with a crescendo of suspense, we'd see them biting nails over a judgement call on whether to use the *accepted* stack overflow answer or go with one of those dubious high value comments.

Of course they'd have to fire up a console and poke around the mandocs for a bit just to be sure they understood the answer they picked.

Intense right?!

I think it would help a lot. Right now the whole world just thinks we sit around and type really fast.
